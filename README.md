React Product Management App
Hi! This is my first React project! ðŸŽ‰
Itâ€™s a simple app for managing products, like adding and viewing them.
Iâ€™m still learning, so please bear with any mistakes. ðŸ˜…

Features
User login using a fake API (just for testing, not real).
Add new products.
View products in a list.
See product count (basic, no fancy charts yet).
Tech Stack
React (still figuring it out).
Tailwind CSS (for styling).
Axios (to handle API calls).
React Router Dom (for page navigation).
How to Run

Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-product-app.git`
 
Install dependencies:
`npm install`

Start the app:
`npm start`
Open in your browser: http://localhost:3000.

Known Issues
Login redirect fixed few hours ago (still debugging ðŸ˜•).
Report page only shows numbers, no charts yet.
Simple validation on login (working on it!).
Feedback
If you try it out, Iâ€™d love to hear your feedback!
Iâ€™ll fix things as I learn more.
Thanks for checking it out! ðŸ˜„
